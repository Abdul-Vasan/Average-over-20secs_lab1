# Average-over-20secs_lab1
This is an Academic project of BITS Pilani for the partial fulfillment of course Embedded Systems Design.

A average calculator was implemented on "MCB2370 Evaluation Board" i.e. a development board by Kiel on with LPC2378 as its processor.
The system displays averaged value of a input signal every 60 seconds, 
the input is sampled every 1 second and comes from potentiometer present on the board.

Kiel Microvision4 was in the development and simulation of the project with embedded C as programming language.
